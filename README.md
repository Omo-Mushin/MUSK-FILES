# EvansApp - A KivyMD Application Prototype

## Overview
EvansApp is a multi-functional mobile/desktop application prototype built using [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) and [KivyMD](https://kivymd.readthedocs.io/). The application demonstrates a variety of UI components and functionalities such as navigation layouts, date and time pickers, bottom navigation, carousels, accordions, custom bottom sheets, and multimedia integration. It serves as a robust template for developing modern, interactive applications.

## Features
- **Dashboard & Navigation**:  
  - MDTopAppBar with action items  
  - MDNavigationDrawer for quick access to various screens  
  - MDBottomNavigation for tab-based navigation  
- **Interactive Widgets**:  
  - MDGridLayout with icon buttons, labels, and custom widgets  
  - Custom tabs and accordions for rich content display  
- **Media & File Handling**:  
  - Video widget integration for media playback  
  - File chooser functionality to load and display images  
- **Pickers & Custom Actions**:  
  - Date and Time pickers (MDDatePicker & MDTimePicker)  
  - Custom bottom sheets for additional actions
